# Hello, this is my take on 42 Warsaw project called "Libft"

This project is mostly about recreation of C functions, such as: `atoi, strstr, strlen, etc.` and building library including those functions. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Functions can lead to memory leaks as that wasn't important part of the project.

Libft is a pretty important library during **`42`** circus, especialy listed functions:
> - ft_split

> - ft_atoi

> - ft_strlen

> - ft_strjoin

> - ft_itoa
